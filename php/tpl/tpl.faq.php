Q.	Someone claims to have sent a payment to my oReserve account but funds do not appear in my account history or in my account balance. What is wrong?
A.	Please note that all payments between oReserve account holders are instantaneous. Every time the payment is made a unique transfer batch number is generated and is displayed in your account history. Account holders can provide this number to each other as proof of their payment. Please note, that if company refuses to provide you with the transfer batch number or provides you with the fake one - the payment, most likely, was never made.
Q.	The company lists your logo or announces that they are working with oReserve. Can this be verified in any way?
A.	Any such claim is FALSE. Please note that oReserve is owned and operated independently of any other business or company.
